# Visual_Fusion_GRU
MMR-PPO: A Multi-Modal Recurrent Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous underwater robotic fish navigation. Features end-to-end sensor fusion (CNN-based vision + Ray-cast sonar), GRU temporal memory for state estimation, and Domain Randomization within Unity ML-Agents. Achieves robust obstacle avoidance and target tracking.
